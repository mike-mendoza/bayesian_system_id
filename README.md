# Bayesian System Identification Jupyter book

**Bayesian System Identification** is a fundamental concept in statistics and probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs when new evidence is available. This approach is rooted in **Bayes' Theorem**, which provides a mathematical framework for revising probabilities based on observed data.

This Jupyter book is part of the Bayesian System Identification crash course which can be found at:
