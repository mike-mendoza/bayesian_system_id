# Introduction
Welcome to the crash course on **Bayesian system identification**. This approach 
allows us to systematically combine:
- Physical/mathematical models of engineering systems
- Noisy sensor measurements
- Prior engineering knowledge and constraints

The result? **Calibrated parameters with quantified uncertainty**.

## Course Structure
Through hands-on exercises, you'll learn to:
1. Apply Bayes' theorem for events
2. Use conjugate priors for analytical solutions  
3. Perform Bayesian inference via numerical integration
4. Use the specialized Bayesian system identification library `probeye`
5. Handle multiple sensors and parameter
6. Apply advanced sampling methods (MCMC, Nested sampling)
7. Compare and select between competing models

## Requirements
To follow along, you will need:
- A Python version between 3.6 and 3.11
- A code editor that supports Jupyter notebooks (e.g., VS Code)
- A virtual environment with the required packages installed: `probeye`, `ipykernel`
