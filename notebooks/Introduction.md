# Introduction

Welcome to the crash course on **Bayesian System Identification**, a fundamental concept in statistics and probability theory that allows us to update our beliefs when new evidence is available. This approach is rooted in **Bayes' Theorem**, which provides a mathematical framework for revising probabilities based on observed data.

In this course, we will explore the key principles of **Bayesian updating**, including:

- Understanding Prior and Posterior Probabilities: Learn how to define and differentiate between prior beliefs and updated beliefs after considering new evidence.
- Applying Bayes' Theorem: Discover how to use the theorem to calculate the posterior probability and make informed decisions.
- Practical applications: Examine examples where Bayesian updating is applied, from medical diagnosis to machine learning.

By the end of this course, you will have a solid grasp of how to implement Bayesian updates in various scenarios, enhancing your analytical skills and decision-making processes. Let's dive in!
