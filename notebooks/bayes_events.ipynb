    "Assuming that 1 in 100 reinforced concrete structures are affected by alkali-silica corrosion (alkali-silica reaction induced corrosion). At early stages the corrosion is not visible from the outside. Since in the long run it can lead to a considerable reduction of strength it is of utmost importance to detect the corrosion as soon as possible and take the necessary countermeasures. \n",

    "Suppose that we have a newly developed non-destructive testing method which detects alkali-silica corrosion in 99% of the cases if there is corrosion (right decision). At the same time it signals detection in 5% of the cases when there is no corrosion (false positive). These numbers are determined based on extensive laboratory and field tests.\n",
